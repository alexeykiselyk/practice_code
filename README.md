# **Practice code** in lead-up to PhD

Simple practice code in C. Two main files:

  own_newton_method.c
  met_has.c

First file displays code which applies Newton's method to a polynomial of order 2.

Second file applies the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to a 2D square grid of a variable number of points. Each point is either on (1) or off (0).

Other files are random stuff that I may explore for future code practicing purposes.
