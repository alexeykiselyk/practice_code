# **Practice code** in lead-up to PhD

Simple practice code in C. Two main files:

  1. own_newton_method.c
  2. met_has.c

1. Displays code which applies Newton's method to a polynomial of order 2
2. Applies the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to a 2D square grid of a variable number of points. Each point is either on (1) or off (0).

Other files are random stuff that I may explore for future code practicing purposes.
