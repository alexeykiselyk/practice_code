# **Practice code** in lead-up to PhD

Simple practice code in C. Two main files:

  `own_newton_method.c` - displays code which applies Newton's method to a polynomial of order 2.
  
  `met_has.c` - applies the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to a 2D square grid of a variable number of points. Each point is either on (1) or off (0).

Other files are random stuff that I may explore for future code practicing purposes.
